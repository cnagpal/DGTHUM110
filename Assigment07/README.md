## Description of Project

I will be redesigning the GIS.NY.GOV website and implementing 2 new features. For this assignment, I used Figma to design and develop my high fidelity prototype. By recieving feedback from my classmates and conducteing cognitive walkthoughs, I improved the designs and interaction of my prototype. I was able to improve the usability of my interactive prototype by seeing how the particpants were able to carry out certain tasks supported by it. 

These tasks/features are:

(1) A filter feature that allows users to sort through datasets by theme or by sector. The protoype specifically supports sorting by the theme "soils" to demonstrate what the full capability could look like.

(2) Using the top bar to return to previous pages visited by the user seamlessly, unlike the original webpage. The protoype supports going back from "dataset details" to "search results" to "search". This way, in addition to the default back buttons on browsers, there is another way for user to revert and exit. 

(3) The ability to view a dataset description and download metadata or data, which is represented with the Geologic Maps dataset.
