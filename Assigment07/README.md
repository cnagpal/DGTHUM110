# Assignment 07: HighFiPrototype

## Description of Project

I will be redesigning the GIS.NY.GOV website and implementing 2 new features. For this assignment, I used Figma to design and develop my high fidelity prototype. By recieving feedback from my classmates and conducteing cognitive walkthoughs, I improved the designs and interaction of my prototype. I was able to improve the usability of my interactive prototype by seeing how the particpants were able to carry out certain tasks supported by it. 

These tasks/features are:

(1) A filter feature that allows users to sort through datasets by theme or by sector. The protoype specifically supports sorting by the theme "soils" to demonstrate what the full capability could look like.

(2) Using the top bar to return to previous pages visited by the user seamlessly, unlike the original webpage. The protoype supports going back from "dataset details" to "search results" to "search". This way, in addition to the default back buttons on browsers, there is another way for user to revert and exit. 

(3) The ability to view a dataset description and download metadata or data, which is represented with the Geologic Maps dataset.

Not all the interactions are represented through flow arrows so as to mantain clarity. 

## Cognitive Walkthrough

In class, a cognitive walkthrough I did with my peers in the breakout room is what resulted in this iteration. I shared with them my [digitized wireframes](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/main/Assignment06/README.md) from the last assignment so they could "walk" through each task, noting down problems or difficulties as they go. A difficulty that came up was that there is more than one appropriate way to filter through the content, but I was only providing users with one way - through themes. In addition, since there are so many themes to filter by, scrolling through tags that are displayed across the screen seemed tedious. Because of this feedback, I added drop down menus users can use to filter. Based on previous research, I found that the most pertinent items to filter by are themes and sector, so these are the two I emphasized. 

With the second iteration of cognitive walkthroughs, I enlisted the help of my classmates, Aye Paye and Amanda Johnson. These walkthoughs are scheduled to take place on Thursday/Friday night and I will supplement information here post-walkthrough.
