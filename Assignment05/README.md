# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Overview

Project: In this project, I am redesigning the http://gis.ny.gov/ website to be more user-friendly. This site serves a specific kind of user: those looking for data regarding New York state's Geographic Information Systems. They are likely to be students, researchers, etc. TO learn more about this, the user personas and scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/tree/main/Assignment04). Based on my user research, I was able to decide on new features to implement to improve the users experience on this website. 

Features: (1) A page for every data set that includes the description and ability to navigae to the the data set owner's page. (2) A page for each data set owner that lists their owned data sets and contact information. (3) A tags feature to more aesthetically filter for specific data sets

Purpose: By making this low fidelity prototype, I hope to be able to test the functionality of the new features I proposed for the http://gis.ny.gov/ website. The features were meant to satisfy personas so I need to learn if they also work for people in reality. I can test the features with a member of the target demographic to get feedback in an affordable way, before moving forward and designing a high fidelity prototype. 

Tasks: To test the functionality of the features I propsed, I will ask the test user to perform a few tasks. This will show me if it is straightfroward to navigate between the two pages and learn information from them, feature 1 and 2. It will also show me if the tags feature is intuitive to use as well, feature 3. 

For the task I will ask the user to navigate to the a data set about  using the tags feature. Then, I will ask them to navigate to the owner's page.
