## Two Personas

## Scenario 1 w/ Melissa (Features 1 & 2)

### Why 

Melissa is a student and needs to find geographic data about New York to complete her research project. She's looked online at open source data sharing sites but they don' have the kind of specific and technical information she needs. She is able to find lots of free data, but the kind she needs for her project isn't available publicly and freely. 

### How

She decides to look up government websites to find people that own the data she needs so she can directly contact them. She finds GIS.NY.GOV. This site allows her to easily find data sets that she would be interested in using. When she clicks on a data set, it takes her to a page that clearly shows her a summary of the metadata - information about the data set - and who she should get into contact with to access the data  and for any other information. This information is all on the same page, without many clicks needed to get there. She can also click directly on a button of the dat set owners name to access that member's page and see all the other data they have worked on. This is useful to her, because as a curious student, she would like to learn more about the data she is using. SHe also wants to able to easily see what other sets a single owner has so she can request access to multiple at a time for her large scale project. This way, she can also ask the owner questions about the data sets together at the same time.
