## Proposed Features

1. A singular, cohesive page with metadata summary and data set owner contact
2. A site member landing page with all of their owned data sets and contact information
3. A tags feature to more aesthetically filter for specifically themes data sets

## Two Personas

## Scenario 1 w/ Melissa (Features 1 & 2)

### Why 

Melissa is a student and needs to find geographic data about New York to complete her research project. She's looked online at open source data sharing sites but they don' have the kind of specific and technical information she needs. She is able to find lots of free data, but the kind she needs for her project isn't available publicly and freely. 

### How

She decides to look up government websites to find people that own the data she needs so she can directly contact them. She finds GIS.NY.GOV. This site allows her to easily find data sets that she would be interested in using. When she clicks on a data set, it takes her to a page that clearly shows her a summary of the metadata - information about the data set - and who she should get into contact with to access the data  and for any other information. This information is all on the same page, without many clicks needed to get there. She can also click directly on a button of the dat set owners name to access that member's page and see all the other data they have worked on. This is useful to her, because as a curious student, she would like to learn more about the data she is using. SHe also wants to able to easily see what other sets a single owner has so she can request access to multiple at a time for her large scale project. This way, she can also ask the owner questions about the data sets together at the same time. She likes to be thorough so these features appeal to her. 

### Journey Map 

## Scenario 2 w/ Andrew (Feature 3) 

### Why 

Andrew is a working professional who has a lot of experienc with data science and is experienced with searching for data sets. However, he can be overconfident and doesn't spend any time on poorly designed sites that he would have to spend a long time searching on. He needs to find data often for his job, and this tim,e he needs to create a visualization about traffic accidents in New York State. He finds many websites but quickly abandons them because they are difficult for him to navigate and make him feel inadequate.

### How 
At the suggestion of his coworker, Andrew looks up government webistes for New York to find the data for his job. He finds GIS.NY.GOV. There is a cool feature on this site where there are tags present on the landing page. This way, he can simply click one button and be taken immediately to all data sets that fit a given theme. He scrolls for a very brief amount of time, seeing tags like orthoimagery, parks/recreation, etc. Fianlly he see it! A tag called transportation. This is relevant and he immeditely recognizes that his needed data will be under this category, and he is correct. This validates his as a user. He finds the trafic accidents data set easily, and is able to put his time and energy into creating a beautiful data visualization, his favorite part of this job!
