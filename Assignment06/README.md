# Assignment 6: Interface Design

### Charvi Nagpal DH110

## Project Brief

My project aims to make it a more simple process for users to both locate and learn more about the data they use. In this assignment I will be revising my previous wireflow draft and making it digital, using the prototyping tool Figma. The interface design's purpose in this case is to make this more accessible for all users, which includes making sure the text and color contrasts used are readable and color-blind safe. It's purpose is also to create emphasis for certain aspects and convey the state and identity of aspects.

### Layout Test

I used 16 rows and 7 columns. The gutter is 10. 

### Three Typographic Variations

The type here is in various sizes throughout but none smaller than 14 px. The name of the website GIS.NY.GOV is the largest thing at 24 px. I used the following font families: Montserrat, Gothic A1, and Encode Sans. The font line height is 32 throughout.

### Three Shape Variations

In the variation, I first changed the rounded boxes to be much less round and more rectangular. In the other variation I removed the boxes that contained the search results and instead seperated them with horizontal lines. I also created a button for the contact instead of an underlined hyperlink. 

### Two Color Schemes

![color2](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/06dd856abbbc38a456a2cc363af33dd558c0c198/Assignment06/Dark.JPG)

The first is the default wireframe I have been using, with a light color scheme. Instead of a white background, I used #F2F2F2 as suggested by Adobe Extract Theme. The colors were pulled from the original website, which did not have a logo. This is why the screens seem pretty monochrome, using mainly shades of blue and gray. I also used the color #232226 for text and #DEDCDC for results boxes. For the tags, I used the color #C4C4C4. The second wireframe is with a dark theme, with color #496373 as the background instead of in the top bar. The top bar is now #DEDCDC. I have just swapped some of the pre-existing colors to create a darker color scheme overall. 

## Accessibility Test

These are some screenshots of contrast checking the text against the backgrounds.

## Impression Test

Positive Remarks:
"I like the rounded boxes the most" 
"The monochromatic look is cool"
"The interface is simple and seems like it would be easy enough to use"
"No visual clutter"

Negative:
"I wish there were more picture, like icons."
"It maybe is too empty looking"

Overall, I think this interface is successfully designed. In the impression test, I asked my roommates to all give their thoughts on the different variation. They all seemed to find it simple and clean looking, and anticipated it to be easy to use. Though one of roommates thought the design was simple looking in a positive way, the other one thought that it could use more visual elements as it was too blank. Personally, I think that the simple design suits a government website.
