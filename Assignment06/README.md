# Assignment 6: Interface Design

### Charvi Nagpal DH110

## Project Brief

My project aims to make it a more simple process for users to both locate and learn more about the data they use. In this assignment I will be revising my previous wireflow draft and making it digital, using the prototyping tool InVision. The interface design's purpose in this case is to make this more accessible for all users, which includes making sure the text and color contrasts used are readable and color-blind safe. It's purpose is also to create emphasis for certain aspects and convey the state and identity of aspects.
