## Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

My project would support the user activity of searching for data sets owned by New York state agencies and local governments. It will hopefully make it easier and more straightforward for users to accomplish this task.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

Referencing [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs), the basic need that this activity fullfills is the need for cognition. Searching for data sets is an activity that is likley tied to a bigger project, like a research paper or data analysis. This feeds a user's need for exploration, discovery, knowledge, and understanding. 

### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the need of cognition?

Currently, if a user wants to fullfill their cognition need, they might try the traditional method of finding information at the library. They might ask a librarian for help with finding primary source data or other information. Users might also try a simple google search to look for data. There are also specific websites users can visit to find free data sets, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [Socrata](https://opendata.socrata.com/). 

### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

A limitations regarding data searching in person and online is the availability of data sets. Users are limited to what a library has available and limited to what free data sets have been uploaded to these sites. Other useful data sets exist but aren't as easily available. By improving the design of this website and making it more functional and accessible, users will be able to easily reach out to owners of data sets that aren't freely availble on data set sharing sites or in libraries. In cases where data is availble for download on this website, 

## Step 2: Identify target users

### What are the characteristics of users?

Demographics: Students, researchers, and professional data analysts would likley be the mainstream audience, while data hobbyists would be more extreme users.

Preferences: Have the desire to obtain data sets, for research, learning, or projects. 

Expertise: Users do not have to be experts to use the site itself, but may need to be well versed in data sets to be able to interpret them and gain use out of them. 

### In which context would the users do that activity? 

Users would perform the activity asociated with this webpage likely in a professional/working or university environment. They would do this to meet goals/tasks established in their career or university course. 

### What do users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

To find data sets, users would likely search the internet, visit sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [Socrata](https://opendata.socrata.com/), or visit a library. 

## Step 3: Research Method and Plam

I decided on a combination of research methods. I will be conducting an **interview** and **participatory observation** through a a small user activity.

In the user activity, I asked the user to use a data set search website to see how they generally interact with a webpage that serves this function. Also to observe what features they like and gravitate towards using when looking for data. I also asked the user questions in an interview about their searches for data in everday life.

The user chosen for this contextual inquiry is a math major at UCLA. This user adequetely meets the requirement of a student that likely uses data in their school assignments and projects, and has conducted searches for data sets in the past. 

## Step 4: Interview Guide

The link to the **interview guide** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDuoKffRKIUAyq6ABM2Oo4nrJJf8OYtK5h05zG0BuM0/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Step 5: Contextual Inquiry Data

The **transcription** of the interview can be found [here]().


## Step 6 Reflection: 

From this contextual inquiry, one of the things I learned is that people do not go to libraries to look for data or primary source information as much as they use the internet to find these things. 

Something I would have liked to do differently is to choose a volunteer that performs searches for data sets more frequently. As an undergraduate student, the user I had chosen did not have as much experience with this task and perhaps had less insight into this process. A graduate student or working professional in the realm of data science might have been a beter choice. I also could have done more research about the kinds of people that use data sets and their reasons for doing so, as this would've enabled me to come up with more thoughtful questions.
