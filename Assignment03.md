## Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements

### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

My project would support the user activity of searching for data sets owned by New York state agencies and local governments. It will hopefully make it easier and more straightforward for users to accomplish this task.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

Referencing [Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs), the basic need that this activity fullfills is the need for cognition. Searching for data sets is an activity that is likley tied to a bigger project, like a research paper or data analysis. This feeds a user's need for exploration, discovery, knowledge, and understanding. 

### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the need of cognition?

Currently, if a user wants to fullfill their cognition need, they might try the traditional method of finding information at the library. They might ask a librarian for help with finding primary source data or other information. Users might also try a simple google search to look for data. There are also specific websites users can visit to find free data sets, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [Socrata](https://opendata.socrata.com/). 

### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

A limitations regarding data searching in person and online is the availability of data sets. Users are limited to what a library has available and limited to what free data sets have been uploaded to these sites. Other useful data sets exist but aren't as easily available. By improving the design of this website and making it more functional and accessible, users will be able to easily reach out to owners of data sets that aren't freely availble on data set sharing sites or in libraries. In cases where data is availble for download on this website, 

## Step 2: Identify target users

### What are the characteristics of users?

Demographics: Students, researchers, and professional data analyaists would likley be the mainstream audience, while data hobbyists would be more extreme users.

Preferences: Have the desire to obtain data sets, for research, learning, or projects. 

Expertise: Users do not have to be experts to use the site itself, but may need to be well versed in data sets to be able to interpret them and gain use out of them. 

### In which context would the users do that activity? 

Users would perform the activity asociated with this webpage likely in a professional/working or university environment. They would do this to meet goals/tasks established in their career or university course. 

### What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

To find data sets, users would likely search the internet, visit sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [Socrata](https://opendata.socrata.com/), or visit a library.
