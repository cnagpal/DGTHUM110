## Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements

### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?

This project would support the activity of searching for data sets owned by New York state agencies and local governments. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

Referencing [Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs), the basic need that this activity fullfills is the need for cognition. Searching for data sets is an activity that is likley tied to a bigger project, like a research paper or data analysis. This feeds one's need for exploration, discovery, knowledge, and understanding. 

### What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the need of cognition?
