# Accessible GIS.NY.GOV Website

## This project examines and improves upon the preexisting Geograhical Informational Systems government website of New York State. TThis website can be used for searching through the websites database of data sets and provide points of contact within sectors of the government to gain access to and learn more about the data. 

## Design Statement

Through this UX project, I hope to help students and researchers alike in their search for data. The preexisting wesbite is cluttered with links, and it is hard to navigate. The data found on this wesbite is unique to the site and should be accessible so those who need it without much difficulty. A website with poor UX might deter users away before they are able to grasp he value of the website, so a redesign is important. By redesignng, my project will assist users of this website in easily searching for data sets that fit their needs, navigating through the website, finding points of contact, and learning more about their data sets. 


## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

I conducted heuristics evaluation and usability testing of the current website first, so I can could get a sense of any general issues that might affect the usability. 

In the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/main/Assignment01/README.md) based on the Nielson Norman 10 Usability Heuristics, I found that several heursitics were being violated. Namely, heuristic 3, user control and freedom, was being violated as the bar at the top of the page often did not accurately display the pathway users took to get to the current page, making it hard undo actions and revert to a previous page. Heuristic 7 is also in violation, as the flexibility and efficiency of use is lacking. The home page for the website is an empty map of New York state that can be clicked on to navigate to any county's data sets, but this is a expert level feature that should likely not be shown to users when they first enter the website, and should not be the main method used of searching through data sets. Heuristic 6, recognition rather than recall, could also use some work, as the search feature is not easy to find, it is buried within the site. Users must click on the "Data" button on the menu, then click "Data Catalog" in the drop down menu. Only then can the user search the GIS data set inventories by owner or theme. 

In the [usability testing](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/main/Assignment02/README.md), I aimed to understand the user's pain points by focusing on  these heuristic violations and exploring further, hoping to improve any issues I found through my redesign. I found that the map feature on the home page was difficult for my user to use effectively and that there were consistency issues in the website that should be resolved as well. 

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:

Next, I took into consideration the concerns I uncovered from my heuristics evaluation and usability testing, and proceedd to conduct more user research, namely a [contextual inquiry](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/main/Assignment03.md). My objectives were to learn more about the following questions: 

1. What prompts users to search for data sets and other kinds of primary sources?

2. Where and how they search for this information?

3. What issues do they have while searching and what they wish was improved? 

My research methods were an interview and participatory observation through a a small user activity. I found that people don't use libraries to search for data as much as they use the internet. When looking for data sets, users use websites like Kraggle for their seamless experience, as it is easy to search through these websites because of the features they have, like fltering. Some issues include websites that are not easy to navigate as they can be deterring. I also learned that this users tend to want to spend as little time as possible looking for data sets specific to their needs, to streamlining the search process would be beneficial. 

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]

The main purpose of UX storytelling is to empathize with the user’s perspective. By recognizing the target users’ behaviors, pain points, goals, challenges, the more we can discover what parts of the product need improvement and fixing. Thus, I created two personas, scenarios, and journey maps that reflected the target audience for the GIS.NY.GOV website. Melissa Grant, a data science student eager to learn, and Andrew Smith, a data visualization specialist, were the two personas used in my UX storytelling. Read more about my process [here](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/main/Assignment04/README.md).

## Wireframe, Low Fidelity Prototype, and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

Based on my user research, I aimed to include the following features in my redesign:

(1) A page for every data set that includes the description and ability to navigate to the the data set owner's page. 

(2) A navigation bar at the top that effectively allows users to undo and revert to pevious pages they visted. 

(3) A tags feature to more aesthetically filter for specific data sets

Keeping these in mind, I was able to create low-fidelity wireframes and wireflows demonstrating these features. I was also able to test them and iterate my design. Read more about this part of my process [here]((https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/tree/main/Assignment05). 

After this, I moved onto experimenting with design variations to decide what the more finalized design would be like. To learn more about these variations, go to this [link](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/blob/main/Assignment06/README.md).


## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)

Lastly, I built an interative prototype, which can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/gPgJyfw77nUDkfiqRIgVs2/HiFiPrototype?node-id=2%3A302&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A302&show-proto-sidebar=1). I also conducted a cognitive walkthrough to iterate my design further. This process can be seen in depth [here](https://github.com/cnagpal/DGTHUM110/tree/main/Assigment07). Based on this walkthrough I was able to iterate my design to better serve the user. I changed my tag feature to a filter feature, for example.

## Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?

Prior to this class, I had no experience with the process of UX research and design. So completeing this project helped me understand the foundational steps to UX research and how to apply the findings to the design. It also helped me learn many important aspects of UI design, like accessibility that I was previously unaware of. Overall, I believe I was improved a lot in both the design and research aspects of User Experience. Learning to use tools like Figma and Invision were also very useful to me, as someone interested in pursuing this as a career. Having the ability to iterate my designs through user research was also invaluable to me in my growth as a designer.
