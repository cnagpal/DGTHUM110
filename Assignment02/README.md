## Introduction

In the assignment I will conduct pilot usability testing on the website titled "Geographic Information Systems Clearinghouse". This Clearinghouse, an agency that collects and distributes information, disseminates information about New York's Statewide GIS Coordination Program and provides access to the New York State GIS Data and Metadata Repository. Users can browse the list of GIS data sets, or search for specific keywords, to find out what data is available, who holds it, and how it can be obtained.

For this site, the usability issues I found from my heuristic evaluation were as follows:

(1) Visibility of system status

The navigation bar on top does a poor job commuicating to the user what page they are on due to inconsistencies.

(2) Recognition rather than recall

Rather than making the search bar easy to recognize, it is buried within the site for users to find. Users must click on the "Data" button on the menu, then click "Data Catalog" in the drop down menu.

(3) Flexibility and efficiency of use

Instead of hiding an expert level shortcut from users, this website features it on its homepage. If a user clicks on the webste title, they are taken to the homepage where a map of New York's counties is present, without any labeling.

In this pilot test, I will ask a single user to conduct certain tasks to observe if and/or how these issues hinder the user's ability.

## Methodology
I performed this test in a quiet room in my apartment using my laptop. I used Zoom to conduct and record the pilot usability test, with the user being my friend Lisa.
