## Introduction

In the assignment I will conduct pilot usability testing on the website titled "Geographic Information Systems Clearinghouse". This Clearinghouse, an agency that collects and distributes information, disseminates information about New York's Statewide GIS Coordination Program and provides access to the New York State GIS Data and Metadata Repository. Users can browse the list of GIS data sets, or search for specific keywords, to find out what data is available, who holds it, and how it can be obtained.

For this site, the usability issues I found from my heuristic evaluation were as follows:

(1) Visibility of system status

The navigation bar on top does a poor job commuicating to the user what page they are on due to inconsistencies.

(2) Recognition rather than recall

Rather than making the search bar easy to recognize, it is buried within the site for users to find. Users must click on the "Data" button on the menu, then click "Data Catalog" in the drop down menu.

(3) Flexibility and efficiency of use

Instead of hiding an expert level shortcut from users, this website features it on its homepage. If a user clicks on the webste title, they are taken to the homepage where a map of New York's counties is present, without any labeling.

In this pilot test, I will ask a single user to conduct certain tasks to observe if and/or how these issues hinder the user's ability.

## Methodology
I performed this test in a quiet room in my apartment using my laptop. I used Zoom to conduct and record the pilot usability test, with the user being my friend Lisa. Lisa lived on the East Coast, which made her as close to a target demographic of this website as I could find. The first task was to see how easy the map function on the home page was to use. The second task allowed me to observe if finding the search feature on the website was a difficult task. Lastly, the last task allowed me to observe how easy it was to find help on the website. All the while, I asked questions about how easy was it to keep track of her location in the website to gain more informtaion about the visibility of system status.

## Summary and Relfection
The pilot study went well without many hiccups. There were parts of the test where I wanted to help Lisa find certain things, and I had to remnd myself that she needed to find them on her own for the test to be effective. For usability issue number 1, I found that Lisa did not use the navigation bar on the website at all, rather choosing to just use the back button on her laptop when she needed to navigate back from something. Perhaps if the bar were more consistent and more visible, it would be more enticing and more usable. In regards to the second usability issue, Lisa actually found two different search areas of the website that probably performed the same function but looked entirely different. This was an inconsistency issue on the website as well. Once the search feature was located, it was not too difficult for her to use. Lastly, The map on the homepage did not do what Lisa expected it to, and it was a bit difficult to use for Lisa as well. Overall, the pilot study went well. If I had to change something, I would ask more questions about what the website could do differently to be a better user experience after each task. The user had some good insight and I should have included a section for her to note this down in the google form.
